# WSIFIR
Whole Slide Immunofluorescence Image Registration of Mono-Modal Histopathological Images located on the AstroPath database using ANTsPy. To evaluate the degree of registration, this notebook uses metrics such as Jaccard Index, Dice Similarity Score, and Hausdorff Distance. The notebook is designed to evaluate the alignment of WSI images before and after transformations performed at each image resolution.
